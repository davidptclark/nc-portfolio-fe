Hello! 👋 Welcome to our app - Northcoders Portfolio.
</p>

<br />

## 💭 Description

Northcoders Porfolio is an app to help Northcoders graduates upload short video demonstrations of their projects to a centralised space, that recruiters and employers can efficiently access and browse.

Typically, graduates are limited in visability due to the size of their network or limited reach due to a change in sector. Additionally, recruiters and employers have limited time and resources, which further adds to the issue of visability. We built this app with these challanges in mind, to aleviate frictions or barriers to visibility: allowing graduates to showcase their work, as well as reducing the workload on the employer side in finding newly-qualified graduates.
